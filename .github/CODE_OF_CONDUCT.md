## Enforcement Responsibilities（维护者职责）

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

维护者负责解释与执行上述标准，并将针对其认定为不当、威胁、冒犯或有害的行为，采取适当且公平的纠正措施。

维护者有权且有责任移除、编辑或拒绝不符合本行为准则的评论、提交、代码、Issue 等贡献，并在适当情况下说明原因。

## Scope（适用范围）

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

本准则适用于所有社区空间；当个人在公共场合代表社区时同样适用（如使用官方邮箱、通过官方账号发布信息、作为指定代表参加线上/线下活动等）。

## Enforcement（举报与处理）

Reports of unacceptable behavior may be submitted by contacting the project maintainers via one of the following channels:

- Preferred: GitHub Discussions（if enabled） / or the repository owner
- Alternative: e-mail the maintainers at a project security/contact address you trust

If you are unsure how to reach maintainers, open a minimal issue titled “[CoC] Request contact” without including sensitive details; maintainers will respond with a private channel.

对于不当行为的举报，可通过以下方式联系维护者：

- 推荐：GitHub Discussions（如已启用）或直接联系仓库所有者
- 备选：通过你信任的项目联系邮箱与维护者沟通

如果你不确定如何私下联系维护者，可创建一个标题为“[CoC] Request contact”的最小化 Issue（不要包含敏感细节），维护者将回复可用的私密渠道。

We will respect the privacy and security of the reporter.

我们会尊重并保护举报者的隐私与安全。
